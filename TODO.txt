* Write "Paused" on the screen when paused
* Need to be able to pause from the controller too
* Maybe three lives? If you die you start from where you were a few seconds ago?
  - and maybe the "fuel" objects give extra lives?
* Extending from that, maybe some "walls" could be orange, signifying that they are
  breakable, but would use a life to get through?
* Splash screen
* Menu?
* Next level when level complete
* Change level data file format to YAML or JSON?
* Keyboard controls don't work properly if joystick is attached
* Maybe instead of fuel we should need to collect keys to get into the exit?
