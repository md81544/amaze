* Objects which are not obstacles - just decoration

* Regenerative power? Power level drops with thrust and refills over time

* Menu -> Level Select: use names instead of filenames (still need to add names to many levels)

* Teleport / portals
* Emergency stop? Uses a life?
* Splash screen
* Change level data file format to YAML or JSON? Low/no priority
* Keyboard controls don't work properly if joystick is attached
* (Just an idea) a black cut-out circle around the ship so that rotation doesn't affect
  how far you can look?
* Sometimes when you respawn it is difficult to determine which way you were going:
    * A compass?
    * Maybe a breadcrumb trail?
    * Or a replay of the last few saved positions?
